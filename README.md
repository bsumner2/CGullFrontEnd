To run dev server on localhost port 8000, use testserver.sh, and it will open a
test server. (*Note: testserver.sh requires Python version >= 3.12 as it uses 
Python's http.server module to host a dev server*.) Otherwise, if you want to 
set up the dev server yourself, go to directory ./base and run your http-server 
host of choice from base as the root dir. I put all of the site resources in 
that base folder to keep it separated from all of the git repo files like the
readme, the .git, the testserver script, etc.
